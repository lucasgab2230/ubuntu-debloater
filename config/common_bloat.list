# config/common_bloat.list
# List of packages commonly considered "bloatware" across various Ubuntu and its derivatives.
# This list can be used in conjunction with distribution-specific lists, or as a standalone
# list for a more generic debloating approach.
# Each package name should be on a new line.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and will be ignored by the script.
#
# WARNING: Removing system packages can have unintended consequences.
# Review this list carefully before running the debloater script.
# If you are unsure about a package, it's safer to leave it commented out or remove it from the list.
